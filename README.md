# Go-Micro

**Go-Micro** is a golang package that implements Micro-service architecture 
using **go-kit**.

## What is this project?
In this project, I implemented a microservice application that does string
operations like concat, count, split, ...

The base idea behind this project was to work with **go-kit**, and learn how
to implement a golang application using microservice architecture.

To see how does this project work, check the following schema:<br />

## What is go-kit?
Go kit is a programming toolkit for building microservices 
(or elegant monoliths) in Go. 
It solves common problems in distributed systems and application architecture,
so you can focus on delivering business value.

Go is a great general-purpose language, 
but microservices require a certain amount of specialized support. 
RPC safety, system observability, infrastructure integration, 
even program design â€” Go kit fills in the gaps left by the standard library, 
and makes Go a first-class language for writing microservices in any organization.
